        <li>Drink water or orange juiceFuel your body. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after you work out. Get off to a good start by drinking about 17 to 20 ounces of water about 2 or 3 hours before exercising. A good general rule is to then drink this amount of water: <br>
            8 ounces about 20 to 30 minutes before working out <br>
            8 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes during your workout <br>

        <li>Warm-up and cool-down. Every workout should begin with a warm-up and end with a cool-down period. A warm-up helps your body get ready for exercise. It gradually increases your heart rate and loosens your muscles and joints. Some ways to warm up:
            Ride an exercise bike <br>
            Jump rope <br>
            Jog in place for 5 to 10 minutes <br>
            A cool-down after you work out is important to slowly bring your heart rate back to normal. Walking for 5 to 10 minutes after you work out is one way to cool down. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Stretch. Do dynamic stretching before and after you work out. This will help increase flexibility. Research is conflicting as to whether it can also help prevent injury, it’s best to stretch after you warm up and cool down.</li>
